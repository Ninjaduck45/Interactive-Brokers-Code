Some code I wrote for connecting and reconnecting to Interactive Brokers IB gateway.

I ended up using yahoo to get my data, but I figured it would be a waste to just throw away the code. 

The code is setup to send alerts to discord with their built in webhooks, so all you have to do is paste the adress of the bot you want to send it too.


Hope everyone's day is going well!
